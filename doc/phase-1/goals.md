# Phase 1 Goals

Phase 1 aims to deliver:

- A unified Workspace interface combining content, instruction, and testing
- A content ingestion pipeline (OCR, chunking, tagging, embedding, indexing)
- An instruction editor with translation and reasoning support
- A real‑time Test Bench with retrieval inspection and citations
- Assistant Profile creation from any workspace
- Assistant Profile management and chat interface
- Backend support for all ingestion, retrieval, and synthesis workflows
- Frontend support for the complete workspace lifecycle

Success is defined by a user being able to complete:

Upload Content → Define Instruction → Test → Refine → Create Assistant → Chat
