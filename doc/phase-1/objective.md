# Phase 1 Objective

Phase 1 establishes the Workspace model as the core interaction environment of gErCK.

The objective is to enable users to:

- upload and manage their own content
- define their own reasoning workflow through an instruction set
- test interactions in real time within the same interface
- refine both content and instructions iteratively
- package the workspace into a reusable Assistant Profile

Phase 1 forms the foundation for future capabilities such as structured data intelligence, multi‑agent workflows, and advanced orchestration.
